Detects and recognizes credit card digits (name, number, valid date, type: visa/mastercard) using AI and CV.

## Getting Started

![alt text](output_imgs/output_6.jpg)

To see how I collected the dataset and trained my model please read the README in 'dataset' directory

After you train your model save it as "models/darknet-yolov3_best.weights"

**I coudln't attache the dataset because of private details of the cards holders**

### Prerequisites

python >= 3.6

python libraries:
- opencv-python (cv2)
- flask
- flask_restful
- jsonpickle
- numpy

### Installing

Install libraries using pip3

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Standalone application

```bash
python3 main.py <image_path> 
```
Option: image_path = examples/6.jpg  or  image_path = examples/8.jpg

**Image should be credit card image with minimum background.**


2. Rest API - running https server

```bash
python3 REST_api.py
```

Optional:
```bash
python3 REST_api.py --host <host_ip> --port <port_number>
```

Default argument:

--host = 0.0.0.0

--port = 5000

clinet url should be POST method and looks like this:  http://<host_ip>:<port_number>/pic

**Attach to the request credit card image that filmed from Simplify application.**
